Approach Explanation for Round 1A
Our solution extracts the title and headings (H1, H2, H3) from PDFs using pdfminer.six. The title is identified as the first significant text on page 1. Headings are detected using font size clustering, where the top three distinct font sizes correspond to H1, H2, and H3. Additional heuristics (short text, numbered lines like "1. Introduction") ensure accurate heading identification. The code processes all PDFs in an input directory, saving JSON outputs to an output directory with title and outline (headings with page numbers). It runs offline in a Docker container on an amd64 CPU, with a model size < 200MB using lightweight pdfminer.six. Testing on simple and complex PDFs ensures robust heading detection, though scanned PDFs are not supported. The solution optimizes performance by avoiding OCR and using efficient text extraction, achieving high accuracy for the hackathonâ€™s requirements.
