### ðŸ‘¤ Persona Inference + PDF Summarization + Ranking

This project automatically identifies the underlying persona from a collection of PDFs and generates a ranked summary of the documents based on their relevance to the inferred persona.

---

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **Input PDFs** (in `input/` folder) are parsed and analyzed.
2. The system:
   - **Infers the persona** (e.g., Travel Planner, Food Explorer).
   - **Summarizes each PDF** in 2â€“3 lines.
   - **Ranks PDFs** based on relevance to the inferred persona.
3. A final **`persona_summary.json`** file is generated with all results.

Ensure each PDF is 10â€“15 pages with readable text (non-image-based recommended).

3. Run the Code

bash

python main.py
4. Output

A summary file will be created at output/persona_summary.json.
