In essence, While docker swarm is really easy to setup and get started, it lacks some of the advanced autoscaling features required for complex applications. In essence, Minikube provides an executable command line utility that will automatically download the iso and deploy it in a virtualization platform such as oracle virtualbox or vmware fusion. In essence, Installing all of these various components individually on different nodes and modifying the configuration files to make it work is a tedious task. In essence, So, what i am trying to illustrate in this slide is that, pods usually have a one-to-one relationship with containers running your application. In essence, There are also options available for automatically scaling the replicaset based on load, but that is an advanced topic and we will discuss it at a later time..",
